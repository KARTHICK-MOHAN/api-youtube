# YouTube Clone Site - Flask API Design

This project is a YouTube clone site API built using Python and Flask. The main objective of this project is to learn API design and integration using Flask, enabling users to fetch video feeds from YouTube using the YouTube Data API.

## Features

- Fetch Video Feeds: Users can retrieve video feeds from YouTube by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
- Search Videos: Users can search for videos by providing keywords as query parameters in the API request.
- Video Details: Users can obtain detailed information about a specific video, including its title, description, channel, and thumbnail URL.
- Pagination: API endpoints support pagination to retrieve a specific number of videos per page.
- Error Handling: Proper error handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages and status codes for failed API requests.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The core programming language used for backend development.
- Flask: A lightweight web framework used for handling HTTP requests and responses and creating the API endpoints.
- YouTube Data API: Utilized for fetching video feeds and retrieving video details from YouTube.
- JSON: The data format used for API responses, allowing easy integration with different applications and platforms.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/videos`: Fetches video feeds from YouTube.
- `GET /api/videos/search`: Searches for videos based on the provided keywords.
- `GET /api/videos/{video_id}`: Retrieves details of a specific video using its ID.

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on request parameters and response formats.


## Future Improvements

- User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to enable personalized features like saving favorite videos or creating playlists.
- Video Embedding: Provide embeddable video codes to enable the integration of videos into external websites or applications.
- Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests made to the API per user or IP address.
- Error Logging: Add functionality to log and monitor errors occurring within the API for effective debugging and maintenance.
